# ![](media/image19.png){width="2.2569444444444446in" height="2.4194444444444443in"}Executive Summary

Insightful Health is a Chicago-based startup company focusing on
introducing and spreading hand sanitation and safety throughout the
globe.

At present, we have developed a business model alongside proprietary
protections

that can detect and respond to hand sanitation incidents "at edge." Our
technology detects and then encourages hand sanitation compliance in
almost any environment.

By utilizing a variety of innovative and psychological approaches, we
can increase the cumulative hand sanitation rate in any communal area
while simultaneously restoring confidence in the safety of public
spaces, especially in the era of COVID-19.

During this time of uncertainty, our product is perfectly positioned to
penetrate a broad spectrum of hungry markets; all the while utilizing an
array of sales, marketing, and revenue channels.

We can save lives by

promoting hand sanitation awareness

and raising compliance rates

while utilizing unique marketing tactics

and a multi-pronged revenue strategy

to achieve short and long-term commercial viability.

## Problem

For almost 200 years, the scientific and medical communities have
pioneered hand washing protocols as one of the 4 pillars of infection
prevention and control.

Proper hand sanitation protocols have been credited with other,
significant health benefits:

-   minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and
    other infectious diseases;

-   preventing infectious causes
    of diarrhea;[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_washing#cite_note-cdwt-12) 

-   decreasing respiratory
    infections;[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_washing#cite_note-pcda-13) 

-   and reducing infant mortality rate at home
    birth deliveries.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_washing#cite_note-14)

Despite the clear evidence that hand washing is one of the pillars of
infection prevention and control, public compliance around hand
sanitation is severely lacking. The healthcare industry, the de facto
leaders in hand sanitation, only achieve an estimated rate of 36%
compliance, while most standards call for 90% or above!

The lack of adherence has considerable social and economic consequences:

-   On an annual basis, conservative estimates that hand washing can
    save at least 1 million lives nationally.

-   Within healthcare US hospitals are estimated to lose \$30 billion
    due to the financial impact of Hospital Acquired Infections, while
    global costs are estimated at \$15 trillion annually.

The COVID-19 pandemic will likely end up costing between \$8.1 and
\$15.8 trillion globally.

-World Economic Forum

## Solution

Thea is a patent pending IoT Device which combines a number of
technologies to detect and respond to hand sanitation incidents at Edge.

-   Predicts if a subject is adhering to hand hygiene protocols in
    real-time

-   Proactively warns and prompts for hand sanitation if compliance is
    not occurring

-   If violation occurs, logs the incident for further policing

-   Provides reports detailing key performance indicators and deeper
    metrics for process improvement

-   Non-intrusively changes human behavior

![](media/image22.png){width="3.972916666666667in"
height="5.965277777777778in"}

## Market Opportunity

Increasing hand sanitation from the current estimate of 36% to the
recommended 90% compliance rate would save 900,000 lives globally a
year. Additionally, \$11.5 trillion in healthcare costs would be
eliminated.

The total market size for HAI is projected to be at \$1.10 -2.54
billion/year in the US alone. At thousands of occurrences each day, each
missed opportunity will cost the hospital anywhere between \$25 -- 75.

The average 200-bed hospital will pay an estimated \$3.56 million/year
in HAI-related costs due to hand hygiene non-compliance. A single
infection of MRSA can cost a hospital over \$30K.

## Competitive Advantages

We are bringing to market a pioneering system that has advantages over
insufficient and antiquated solutions from current marketplace
competitors by providing the following innovations:

-   The first real-time compliance mechanism

-   The first in predictive notifications

-   The first device that gets more accurate over time by learning by
    itself

-   The first automated device with high-detection precision

-   High accuracy in monitoring and data reporting in the field

-   Lower implementation costs through employee self-onboarding

-   Visitor compliance possible

-   Easily scalable

-   Low total cost of ownership

-   HIPAA-compliant

# Our Beginnings

## mHUB Partnership

In late 2018, we were accepted into the incubator and accelerator
program at mHUB.

mHUB fosters connections between local manufacturers, university
researchers and the entrepreneurial community of makers and
technologists. By galvanizing these connections, mHUB ensures that US
manufacturing industry continues to grow, lead, and reduce the cost and
barriers to entry for physical product innovation.

For these, and the following reasons, we chose mHUB over several other
incubators and accelerators, such as yCombinator and Matter Health. We
have since benefited greatly from this relationship in the areas of
product engineering, system design, and overall entrepreneurial
consulting. This partnership has been instrumental to the transition
from concept to a marketable product.

In February, we received 2^nd^ place and our first grant competing in
the 2020 mHUB Venture Challenge. This award is considered one of the
highest honors for a startup in the technology & manufacturing industry.

## Thea Prototype & Proof of Concept

A hand sanitation monitoring and compliance system, codenamed Thea, is
born.

Thea is a patent-pending system of IoT devices which combines AI,
Computer Vision, and Deep Learning "at edge" (directly on the device) to
detect and respond to hand sanitation incidents. Because of this
feature, Thea has the ability to affect hand hygiene compliance in
real-time using methods that were previously unfeasible.

At its core, Thea has the ability to monitor subjects and proactively
encourage hand sanitation in real-time. In a controlled environment,
Thea was successful in ingesting real-life images and determining if
hand sanitation was occurring at an almost 90% success rate.

## Pre-Pilot

In May of 2019, Thea underwent a pre-pilot involving 2 hospitals\* in
the Cleveland area. Both hospitals are considered medium-sized with
around 200 beds each. Reported data from hospital leadership suggested
that the cumulative hand sanitation rate (CHSR) was ***consistently
above 90%.***

On separate days at each location, four devices were set up and ran for
20 cumulative hours (40 hours in total)

Our devices collected image streams of everyday hospital activities

Our Deep Learning model extracted hand sanitation compliance incidents
vs other hospital activities and then processed the incidents

A CHSR was calculated using our algorithm

The CHSR was validated through human observation and manual tallying,
proving our algorithm's accuracy.

To reiterate, current and antiquated measurement methods such as
self-reporting and secret observers caused hospital administrators to
believe their CHSR was significantly higher than the actual percentage.

In our limited testing, we calculated the actual CHSR to be at 22%!
